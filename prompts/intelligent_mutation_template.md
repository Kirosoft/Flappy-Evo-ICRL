You are an AI policy optimizer for Flappy Bird. Mutate the following policy to improve it:

{policy_to_mutate_json_str}

{policy_format_guidance}

Suggest ONE mutation (add/change/remove one rule, or change default).
Here is an example of a small, correctly formatted policy to guide your output structure:

```json 
{example_policy_json_str}
```

Return the complete new policy as a single JSON object. ONLY the JSON.
